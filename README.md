# sEMG-hand-movement-recognition-based-on-spectrogram

This repository contains a framework for recognizing hand movements using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The methodology uses signal processing techniques, including filtering and spectrogram-based feature extraction, to enhance classification accuracy.

## Features

* **sEMG Signal Preprocessing**: Noise reduction and filtering for clean signal acquisition.
* **Spectrogram-Based Feature Extraction**: Application of overlapping windows to generate time-frequency representations.
* **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Feature selection and classification of hand movements.
* **Reproducible Workflow**: Code structured for easy experimentation and adaptation.

## Dataset 

The dataset used for feature extraction is located in the **Hand** directory. This folder is structured into three separate subdirectories, each corresponding to a different hand movement performed.


## Requirments 

* Python 3.x
* Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
