# sEMG-hand-movement-recognition-based-on-spectrogram

This repository contains a framework for recognizing hand movements using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The methodology uses signal processing techniques, including filtering and spectrogram-based feature extraction, to enhance classification accuracy.

## Features

sEMG Signal Preprocessing: Noise reduction and filtering for clean signal acquisition.
Spectrogram-Based Feature Extraction: Application of overlapping windows to generate time-frequency representations.
Machine Learning Pipeline: Feature selection and classification of hand movements.
Reproducible Workflow: Code structured for easy experimentation and adaptation.
